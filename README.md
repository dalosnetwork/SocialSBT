# Social SBT

This repository hosts the smart contract for a unique non-transferable token (NTT) designed to facilitate a voting-based point system within decentralized communities such as DAOs. The token leverages the concept of soulbound tokens (SBTs) to create a digital representation of membership, participation, and reputation within a community.

# Key Features:
Minting Mechanism: Users can mint their own token.

Non-Transferability: Once minted, tokens are bound to the owner's wallet and cannot be transferred, emphasizing the personal value and commitment to the community.

Deletion Option: Owners have the right to delete their token, allowing for a form of opt-out from the community if desired. If the user does this, they get back the fee they paid to mint the token.

Point System: Each token starts with zero points. Token holders can initiate proposals to increase their token's points, which are then voted on by the community.

Voting Rights: Each wallet holding a token gets one vote per proposal, ensuring equitable participation.

Duration and Approval: Voting periods last for three days, and proposals require over 50% approval to pass, ensuring community consensus.

Utility: Points can be used within the community for various purposes, such as influencing DAO decisions, accessing special privileges at events, or establishing a social hierarchy.

# Use Cases:
DAO Governance: Points accumulated through successful proposals can equate to voting power, introducing a merit-based influence system.

Event Access: High-point holders might receive VIP access or special benefits, rewarding active community members.

Reputation System: Points serve as a transparent measure of an individual's contribution and engagement within the community.

# Getting Started:
If you want to import SocialSBT into the smart contract you wrote yourself, you can pull the code of the contract and integrate it directly from github.
